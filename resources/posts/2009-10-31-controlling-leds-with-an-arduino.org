#+title: Controlling LEDs with an Arduino
#+tags: arduino

This post will cover the process of controlling multiple LED's using an
Arduino. With this hack we'll make the Arduino, send a distress signal
using a LED, a second LED is used to indicate the end of SOS cycle.

Both LED's are connected the same way except to different pins (Digital
10 and 9). +5V is connected to the resistor which is connected to the +
(long leg) of the LED, - (short leg) of the LED is connected to the
ground.

Any resistor that is bigger than 330 ohms can be used, but keep in mind
that the smaller the resistance the bigger the glow.

First some definitions,

#+begin_src java
  int redLEDPin = 10;
  int yellowLEDPin = 9;
#+end_src

I choose to use pin 10 for the red LED, pin 9 for yellow LED.

#+begin_src java
  int shortPulse = 250;
  int longPulse = 125;
  int letterDelay = 1000;
#+end_src

Morse code uses a short element and a long element to represent letters
and numbers. We will use 250 ms for long element 125 ms for short
element, after each letter we'll have 1 second delay.

#+begin_src java
  //letters 0 for short pulse 1 for long
  int letterS[] = {0, 0, 0};
  int letterO[] = {1, 1, 1};
  
  void setup(){
    pinMode(redLEDPin, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(yellowLEDPin, OUTPUT);
  }
#+end_src

blinkLetter takes an array as it's argument, it will iterate over the
array blink the red LED accordingly.

#+begin_src java
  void redLed(int time){
      digitalWrite(redLEDPin, HIGH);
      delay(time);
      digitalWrite(redLEDPin, LOW);
      delay(time);
  }
#+end_src

redLed function takes a time variable as its input it will keep the LED
on for the given time.

#+begin_src java
  void yellowLed(){
      digitalWrite(yellowLEDPin, HIGH);
      delay(2000);
      digitalWrite(yellowLEDPin, LOW);
  }
#+end_src

To represent the letters, I used an array, 1 to represent a long
element, 0 to represent a short element.

#+begin_src java
  void blinkLetter(int* letter){
    for(int i=0; i<3; i++){
      int val = letter[i];
  
      if(val == 0)
        redLed(shortPulse);
      else
        redLed(longPulse);
    }
    delay(letterDelay);
  }
#+end_src

yellowLed uses a fixed time to signal us that the SOS cycle is complete,
we are starting over.

#+begin_src java
  void loop() { 
    blinkLetter(letterS);
    blinkLetter(letterO);
    blinkLetter(letterS);
  
    yellowLed();
  }
#+end_src

Main loop just cycles through the letters and blink the yellow LED to
signal us that the cycle is complete.  When the circuit is hooked-up
and code uploaded, it should look like this.
