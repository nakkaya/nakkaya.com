#+title: Cloning Pong Part 2
#+tags: clojure arduino pong

This write up is part two of cloning pong, we will modify the pong
game we created in [[http://nakkaya.com/2009/12/19/cloning-pong-part-1/][part one]], to be able to control it with knobs, like
the original using [[http://www.arduino.cc/][Arduino]].

To get Java communicate via Serial Port there are two options,
[[http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/][JavaComm]] API and [[http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/][rxtx]] API. Arduino uses rxtx so I went with
that. Navigate to you Arduino installation folder, for Mac OS X
navigate into the Arduino.app,

#+begin_example
  open /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java/
#+end_example

From the folder copy,

 - RXTXcomm.jar
 - librxtxSerial.jnilib

to somewhere on your classpath. Do not compile rxtx yourself, when I
compiled it manually and put it on my classpath, Arduino IDE could not
connect to the board, use the one supplied with your IDE, Mac OS X users
make sure you are using 32 bit Java 1.5.0 otherwise you will get class
not found exceptions.

Open Arduino IDE and make a note of your serial port name, on my machine
its,

#+begin_src clojure
  (def arduino-port "/dev/tty.usbserial-A6008nhh")
#+end_src

In order to open the serial port for I/O we need to get a port
identifier from the API,

#+begin_src clojure
  (defn port-identifier []
    (let [ports (CommPortIdentifier/getPortIdentifiers)]
      (loop [port (.nextElement ports)
             name (.getName port)]
        (if (= name arduino-port)
          port (recur (.nextElement ports) (.getName port))))))
#+end_src

Using the identifier we can open the port for I/O, make sure baud rates
match between Clojure and Arduino,

#+begin_src clojure
  (defn open-port []
    (doto (.open (port-identifier) "pong" 10000) 
      (.setSerialPortParams 
       9600 SerialPort/DATABITS_8 SerialPort/STOPBITS_1 SerialPort/PARITY_NONE)))
#+end_src

Now everything is set to read from the port,

#+begin_src clojure
  (defn poll-port [p]
    (with-open [in (BufferedReader. (InputStreamReader. (.getInputStream p)))]
      (.readLine in)))
#+end_src

Arduino will map knob reading between 0 and board size and will send
coordinate pairs every 50 milliseconds, when poll-port is called, it
will return,

#+begin_example
  "100:200"
#+end_example

meaning player one is at y 100 and player two is at y 200. We modify
move-player function to check serial for input, parse the coordinates
returned and set the player positions accordingly,

#+begin_src clojure
  (defn move-player [coords player]
    (try
      (let [p1-y (BigInteger. (first (re-split #":" coords)))
            p1-x (:x (:1 @player))
            p1-src (:src (:1 @player))
            p2-y (BigInteger. (second (re-split #":" coords)))
            p2-x (:x (:2 @player))
            p2-src (:src (:2 @player))]
        (dosync (alter player merge 
                       {:1 {:x p1-x :y p1-y :src p1-src } 
                        :2 {:x p2-x :y p2-y :src p2-src}})) )
      (catch Exception e)))
#+end_src

Because we don't listen for key inputs anymore, we need to modify
actionPerformed call and move players before every repaint,

#+begin_src clojure
  (actionPerformed 
   [e] 
   (move-player (poll-port serial) player)
   (move-ball ball)
   (wall-collision ball player)
   (player-collision ball player)
   (.repaint this))
#+end_src

Thats all the modification needed in our pong game. Code for the Arduino
is even simpler,

#+begin_src c++
  const int boardheight = 400;
  const int p1Potpin = 0;
  const int p2Potpin = 1;
  
  void setup(){
    Serial.begin(9600);
  }
  
  void loop(){
  
    int p1 = analogRead(p1Potpin);
    int p2 = analogRead(p2Potpin);
  
    Serial.print(map(p1,0,1024,0,400));
    Serial.print(":");
    Serial.println(map(p2,0,1024,0,400));
  
    delay(50);
  }
#+end_src

We just read read the potentiometers every 50 milliseconds, map the
reading between 0 and board height and write it to serial. Hardware
setup looks like the following, fritzing project is also available check
