#+title: Clodiuno/Processing ADXL335 Accelerometer
#+tags: clojure clodiuno arduino processing

Another one of my spend sometime doing it and didn't want to throw away
the code posts, nothing fancy just processing the accelerometer data,
the accelerometer in question is a ADXL335, you can plug it by
connecting the VCC connector into the Arduino 3V pin (not the 5V pin.),
the ground into ground and the x, y, and z pins into 0,1,2 analog pins.

The idea here is to use the accelerometer to sense orientation
of the Arduino and rotate a 3D object on screen accordingly. Most of the
code is straightforward the only thing that you need to know is that you
can't directly map accelerometer reading to an angle, the reason being even
if you set the thing on the table it will jiggle wildly, to combat that
we need a filter to smooth out the values, this snippet uses the
recursive moving average filter (basically it's like saying, "Well, I've
got a new point, but I don't really trust it, so I'm going to keep 80%
of my old estimate of the measurement, and only trust this new data
point 20%"). It does get rid of the jiggling behaviour but introduces
latency.
